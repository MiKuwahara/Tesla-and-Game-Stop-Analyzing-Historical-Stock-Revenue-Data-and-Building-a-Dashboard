# Tesla and GameStop: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

This project uses __yfinance__, a Python library, to extract stock information from Yahoo Finance to analyze the behavior of a company's share price throughout the years.

Additionally, this project uses __web scraping__ via BeautifulSoup, another Python library, to extract the revenue data of a company.

This data goes through a transformation, including removing null values and empty strings from the extracted data. Then, it is plotted for analysis.
